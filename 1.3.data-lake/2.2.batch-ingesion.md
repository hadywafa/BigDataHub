### **🛠 1️⃣ Identify Source Systems**

The **first step** in batch ingestion is identifying where the data originates.

✅ **Common data sources**:

- Relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- APIs (REST, GraphQL)
- Log files & system events
- Cloud storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage)

✅ **Questions to consider**:

- What **data formats** are used (CSV, JSON, Parquet)?
- What is the **data volume** and how often does it change?

---

### **⏳ 2️⃣ Schedule Data Extraction**

Once data sources are identified, **a schedule is set for extraction**.

✅ **Scheduling intervals** depend on the business need:

- **Daily** – Sales & transaction reports
- **Hourly** – Log processing & system monitoring
- **Weekly** – Customer engagement analytics

✅ **Common scheduling tools**:

| Tool                   | Purpose                |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Apache Airflow**     | Workflow automation    |
| **AWS Step Functions** | Cloud-based scheduling |
| **Crontab (Linux)**    | Basic job scheduling   |

💡 **Best Practice**: Extract data **during off-peak hours** to reduce system load.

---

### **🔄 3️⃣ Apply Data Transformation (ETL Process)**

After extraction, the data is **cleaned and transformed** before loading into the Data Lake.

✅ **Common transformation tasks**:

- Remove **duplicates & corrupted records**.
- Convert **data formats (CSV → Parquet)** for optimization.
- Apply **aggregations & enrichments**.

✅ **ETL Tools for Transformation**:

| Tool                   | Function                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Apache Spark**       | Large-scale data transformation |
| **AWS Glue**           | Serverless ETL                  |
| **Azure Data Factory** | Cloud-based ETL pipelines       |

---

### **📂 4️⃣ Extract & Load Data into the Data Lake**

Finally, the cleaned data is **stored in the Data Lake** for further processing.

✅ **Storage zones for batch ingestion**:

| Data Lake Zone       | Data Format   |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| **Raw Zone**         | CSV, JSON     |
| **Curated Zone**     | Parquet, ORC  |
| **Exploratory Zone** | Mixed formats |

✅ **Loading Mechanisms**:

- **Bulk file transfers** (SFTP, HDFS, S3).
- **Database dumps** (using Apache Sqoop).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Source as Data Source
    participant ETL as Batch Processing Engine
    participant DataLake as Data Lake Storage

    Source ->> ETL: Extract structured data
    ETL ->> DataLake: Store in Parquet format
```

💡 **Best Practice**: Store **optimized columnar formats** in the **curated zone** for fast analytics.
