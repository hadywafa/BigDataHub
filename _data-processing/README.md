# **🚀 Topics to Study for Data Processing (Stage 2)**

Data processing is crucial for transforming raw data into meaningful insights. Here are the key topics you should study:

---

## **📌 1️⃣ Introduction to Data Processing**

- What is Data Processing?
- Why is it essential in modern data pipelines?
- Types of Data Processing:
  - **Batch Processing** ⏳ (Scheduled data transformations)
  - **Stream Processing** ⚡ (Real-time event processing)
  - **Hybrid Processing** (Combining batch & streaming)

---

## **📌 2️⃣ ETL vs. ELT – Understanding Data Transformation**

- What is ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)?
- What is ELT (Extract, Load, Transform)?
- Differences Between ETL & ELT
- When to Use ETL vs. ELT?
- Common ETL/ELT Tools: Apache Spark, AWS Glue, dbt, Talend, Airflow

---

## **📌 3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Data Quality Management**

- What is Data Cleaning?
- Common Data Issues (Nulls, Duplicates, Inconsistencies)
- Data Validation & Schema Enforcement
- Tools for Data Cleaning (Great Expectations, Trifacta, Apache Beam)

---

## **📌 4️⃣ Batch vs. Streaming Processing**

- **Batch Processing**
  - How it works (Example: Aggregating daily sales reports)
  - Common tools (Apache Spark, AWS Glue, Google Dataflow)
- **Streaming Processing**
  - How it works (Example: Fraud detection in real-time transactions)
  - Common tools (Apache Flink, Spark Streaming, Kafka Streams, AWS Kinesis Analytics)

---

## **📌 5️⃣ Data Processing Architectures**

- **Lambda Architecture** (Batch + Streaming)
- **Kappa Architecture** (Streaming-Only)
- **Micro-batch Processing** (Mini batches for near real-time processing)

---

## **📌 6️⃣ Data Aggregation & Enrichment**

- What is Data Aggregation?
- Transforming raw data into summaries & KPIs
- Real-time vs. Batch Aggregation
- Common tools: Apache Beam, Flink, BigQuery, Redshift

---

## **📌 7️⃣ Data Processing Challenges & Best Practices**

- Handling Late & Out-of-Order Data
- Ensuring Data Consistency & Idempotency
- Fault Tolerance & Recovery Strategies
- Cost Optimization in Data Processing
