# **🔄 Change Data Capture (CDC) – Real-Time Updates in Data Pipelines**

## **📌 Introduction to Change Data Capture (CDC)**

Change Data Capture (CDC) is a technique used to **track changes** in a database and capture them in real-time or near real-time. It ensures **incremental updates** instead of full database replication, reducing processing time and improving efficiency.

### **✅ Why Use CDC?**

- **Real-time data synchronization** across systems
- **Optimized ETL processing**, reducing resource consumption
- **Enables streaming architectures** for event-driven applications
- **Minimizes data transfer costs** by only processing changes

## **1️⃣ How Does CDC Work?**

CDC works by **capturing inserts, updates, and deletes** from a database and forwarding them to downstream systems like data warehouses, lakes, or streaming platforms.

### **📌 CDC Workflow**

```mermaid

    participant SourceDB as 📦 Source Database
    participant CDC as 🔄 Change Data Capture
    participant Queue as 📥 Event Streaming (Kafka, Kinesis)
    participant TargetDB as 🏢 Target Data Store
    participant BI as 📊 Analytics/BI

    SourceDB->>CDC: Detects Changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
    CDC->>Queue: Streams Change Events
    Queue->>TargetDB: Updates Data in Real-Time
    TargetDB->>BI: Provides Fresh Data for Analytics
```

## **2️⃣ Types of CDC Methods**

CDC can be implemented using different methods depending on the database capabilities.

| **CDC Method**          | **Description**                                   | **Best For**                          | **Common Tools**                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Log-Based CDC**       | Reads transaction logs to detect changes          | High-performance, minimal impact      | Debezium, AWS DMS, Kafka Connect                    |
| **Trigger-Based CDC**   | Uses database triggers to track row changes       | Fine-grained control, older databases | Custom SQL Triggers, PostgreSQL Logical Replication |
| **Timestamp-Based CDC** | Identifies changes based on `last_updated` column | Simple, easy to implement             | ETL Jobs with SQL Queries                           |
| **Batch Query CDC**     | Periodically queries for new or modified records  | Low-cost, but high latency            | Apache Nifi, Airflow, AWS Glue                      |

## **3️⃣ CDC in Modern Data Pipelines**

CDC is a key component of **real-time data pipelines**, enabling **fast data updates** across different systems.

    B -->|Streaming Processing| C[Apache Flink / AWS Lambda]
    C -->|Real-Time Data Updates| D[Data Warehouse / Lakehouse]
    D -->|Analytics & AI| E[Power BI, Tableau, Machine Learning]
```

## **4️⃣ Common Use Cases for CDC**

✅ **Data Replication** → Keep data synchronized between OLTP & OLAP systems.  
✅ **Real-Time Analytics** → Update dashboards instantly when new data arrives.  
✅ **Event-Driven Applications** → Trigger actions based on database changes.  
✅ **Streaming ETL Pipelines** → Move only changed data instead of full loads.
